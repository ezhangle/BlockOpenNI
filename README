Block OpenNI
------------
A C++ wrapper for OpenNI

Important:
Current API version this block was compiled with (Current version tested on windows, both with Kinect and Xtion):
OpenNI-Win32-1.1.0.39-Dev
NITE-Win32-1.3.1.5-Dev


2011-06-20:
This block is going through heavy remake and so old code/methods are mixed with new methods for the moment.
I will be changing the way things are handled at the moment when i'm finished. All for better support on multiple devices.





Basic description
-----------------

Support for several generators as Image, IR, Depth and User.
Skeleton tracking support is available.




How to use
----------

You need to install the sensor drivers, OpenNI and NITE.
PrimeSense drivers do not run with Kinect (Works with Xtion). 
Instead, get SensorKinect from avin2 or ros.

--------------------------------

Support for Mac OS X. 

Installation instructions for OS X:

First, get libusb and the kinect patch on http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Manual_Build_under_OSX. Patch libusb.

From http://discussions.info.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2614064&amp;tstart=0, do the following:

env CFLAGS="-arch i386" ./configure; make
mv libusb/.libs/libusb-1.0.0.dylib /tmp/libusb-1.0.0.dylib.i386
make clean
env CFLAGS="-arch x86_64" ./configure; make
mv libusb/.libs/libusb-1.0.0.dylib /tmp/libusb-1.0.0.dylib.x86_64
lipo -create /tmp/libusb-1.0.0.dylib.i386 /tmp/libusb-1.0.0.dylib.x86_64 -output libusb/.libs/libusb-1.0.0.dylib
sudo make install

Install all the stuff on the OpenNI page. Just grab binaries.

Go to https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect. Download the binary file for OS X. Install.

Change to your blocks directory

git clone https://github.com/charlesdietrich/BlockOpenNI.git

You can now compile. However, you will get an xml error when running.

This is a hack: You need to copy BlockOpenNI/samples/BlockOpenNISample/data  to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Build/Products/Debug/. This should be done with a resource.

Now you should be good to go. If you get No PS sensor is connected! error, try running another Kinect program, and then running again.

Now you can repeat above steps with BlockOpenNISkeleton.
